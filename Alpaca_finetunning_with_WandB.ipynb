Protons are positively charged particles and neutrons are neutral particles with no charge. Both of these particles are located in the nucleus of the atom, which is at the center of the atom and contains most of the atom's mass.\\n\\nSurrounding the nucleus of the atom is a cloud of electrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles that are in constant motion around the nucleus. The electron cloud is divided into shells or orbitals, and each shell can hold a certain number of electrons. The number of electrons in the outermost shell, called the valence shell, determines the chemical properties of the atom. \\n\\nIn a neutral atom, the number of protons in the nucleus is equal to the number of electrons in the electron cloud, so the positive and negative charges balance out and the atom has no overall charge.
